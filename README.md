# Notes for the class Stochastic process in biology

#### *Plots were made with [my plotting functions](https://github.com/weitingwlin/matlabutility/tree/master/mfiles).

# m-files (matlab scripts)
### class notes & practice
* **note\_week\_2\_1.m**: simulate Poisson events, plot on a time line
* **note\_week\_3\_2.m**: logistic equation, ODE and Gillespie simulation 
### homework 
* **HW1\_2\_Lin.m**:
* **HW1\_3\_Lin.m**:
* **HW1\_4\_Lin.m**:
   + not sure how to do   
### Utility (everything else)
* **work\_setup.m** : set machine-specific working directory
* **fixsample** : re-sample the original time-population data to create sample at user-assigned time points.
